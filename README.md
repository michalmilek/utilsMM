# React Utilities Repository

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the creation and development of utility functions and components for React applications. The primary goal is to build a comprehensive set of tools that enhance the development experience and provide reusable solutions for common functionality in React projects.

## Current Contents

As of now, the repository includes the following utilities:

- **`useApi` Hook**: A custom React hook for fetching data from APIs with support for lifecycle management and error handling.
- **`useClickOutside` Hook**: This hook allows you to detect and handle clicks outside a specified element, useful for implementing behaviors like closing a modal or dropdown when the user clicks outside of it.
- **`ClickOutsideContainer` Component**: A React component that encapsulates the functionality to detect clicks outside of its children, making it easier to control visibility or interaction states.

## Future Plans

Moving forward, the intention is to expand this repository into a full-fledged library of React utilities. Additional tools and components will be developed and added, such as:

- Enhanced state management hooks.
- More complex fetching utilities capable of handling multiple concurrent requests.
- Utilities for form handling and validation.
- Animation and transition components to improve user interface dynamics.

Each utility will be thoroughly documented with examples and usage guidelines to help integrate them into various projects seamlessly.
